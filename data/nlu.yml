    - desc In the wake of the insensitive comment by Ranveer, and Supreme Courts handling him. I want to disassociate myself with him or his creations. Hence, I wish to delete my account. Will I be getting prorated subscription fees refunded on suspending / deleting my account?

    - I want to cancel my subscription and want a proportionate refund. Reason: I purchased because of Ranveer Allabadadhia's influence, and after knowing what kind of person he is, I no longer wish to continue on Level Supermind.     My details: Name: [Sneha Kapoor](name), Email: [snehakapoor99@yahoo.com](email), Number: [9123456789](number), UUID: [b2c3d4e5-f6a7-11ee-5678-abcdef789012](uuid)

    - I recently subscribed to your application, hoping to make the best use of its features. However, despite my efforts, I found it difficult to follow and engage with the app as I had initially intended. I understand that the terms and conditions state that refunds are not generally provided. However, I am a student currently studying at NITK, and I am in genuine need of the amount spent on this subscription. A refund would be of great help to me in my current situation.

    - I want to unsubscribe due to pathetic comments from the founder of this app on social media. How can I follow a guy who has such a disgusting mentality, and he is talking about meditation? Please refund my money.       My details: Name: [Neha Reddy](name), Email: [nehareddy999@hotmail.com](email), Number: [9900112233](number), UUID: [f6a7b8c9-d0e1-11ee-9012-abcdef678901](uuid)

    - I want my money back. Please send me a refund. I do not want to support Ranveer in his journey. He is fake, and I demand a refund.

    - I recently came across your statements on India‚Äôs Got Latent, and I must say, they were extremely disappointing and hurtful. Your comments have affected me to the extent that I can no longer engage with your platform. Meditation is meant to bring peace and positivity, but after hearing what you said, I find it impossible to continue using Level Supermind. It no longer feels like a space where I can focus or grow. Therefore, I kindly request a full refund for my Level Supermind subscription. Please process the refund to the following UPI ID.       My details: Name: [Deepak Mishra](name), Email: [deepakmishra654@gmail.com](email), Number: [6655443322](number), UUID: [c9d0e1f2-a3b4-11ee-2345-abcdef901234](uuid)  
    - I have recently joined the platform and hardly used it. I have canceled the subscription, but I have still been charged. Please refund the subscription amount on a pro-rata basis immediately, else I will report the issue to the IT ministry of India.        My details: Name: [Anjali Sharma](name), Email: [anjalisharma987@yahoo.com](email), Number: [5544332211](number), UUID: [d0e1f2a3-b4c5-11ee-3456-abcdef012345](uuid)  
    - I have canceled my free subscription yesterday, but still, Rs 1788 was debited from my account. So please cancel my subscription and refund my debited amount.       My details: Name: [Arjun Nair](name), Email: [arjunnair333@gmail.com](email), Number: [9988776655](number), UUID: [e1f2a3b4-c5d6-11ee-4567-abcdef123456](uuid)  
    - I am writing to formally request the immediate cancellation of my subscription to Level Premium, which I subscribed to on January 30, 2024. Additionally, I demand a full refund for the amount paid after decreasing for the days I have used your platform.I came across the video where your mentor ji made an absolutely appalling and morally repugnant statement, asking a participant to choose between watching their parents engage in sexual activity for the rest of her life or participating in it to end it once and for all. The sheer vulgarity and unethical nature of this statement left me utterly disgusted and disturbed.I refuse to be associated with a platform that allows, promotes, or tolerates such disgraceful rhetoric. This goes beyond controversy‚Äîit is outright depraved, offensive, and unacceptable. I cannot, in good conscience, continue to follow any of the so-called ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù preached by this platform.
    - I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally address a serious issue regarding the unauthorized auto-renewal of my subscription and the subsequent deduction of payments despite my repeated cancellations. This is the third time I have raised this concern, and I am now compelled to escalate the matter under applicable Indian laws.This practice is not only in violation of the terms outlined in your policy but also contravenes several consumer protection laws and regulations  yet the payment was deducted without my consent. This constitutes a clear violation of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, specifically Section 14, which defines free consent as a fundamental requirement for any valid contract. Additionally, the unauthorized deduction of funds violates the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which safeguards consumers against unfair trade practices and unauthorized charges.
    - Last year I took the Level Supermind subscription. At that time, auto payment was done. The thing is, on 2nd Feb, an amount was deducted from my account, and that was my emergency fund. Please cancel my subscription and pay me back. It's a humble request üôè I don't have any money to survive now. If I get my salary, I will buy the subscription again. Please help me out of this.       My details: Name: [Rahul Verma](name), Email: [rahulverma123@gmail.com](email), Number: [9876543210](number), UUID: [a1b2c3d4-e5f6-11ee-1234-abcdef123456](uuid)

    - I had opted for a free trial and later canceled my free trial subscription. The trial was supposed to end on 28th Jan 2025. However, Rs 1799 has been deducted from my bank towards subscription.
